Full-time software engineer based in Atlanta. But I also do professional grade scientific research in Indology, Tamil Studies and linguistics relating to the Indian subcontinent, specifically, in Dravidian and Indo-Aryan historical linguistics.

You may see my peer-reviewed publication at Vol 18 No 1 (2011): Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies dealing with the etymology of some important words found in the Rig Veda including the well-known kalyāṇī 'auspicious'.
